//Emotions: 
//Assignment â€“ 1: 
//Concept: Spread of joy 
//These are strange times due to COVID-19 pandemic. 
//The darkness, that is the very first blank canvas represents that. Light fights its way out to get out of that.  

//My concept is spread of joy and growth. A small flower starts blooming in 
//ultimate darkness and helps spread light. It spreads light and gives hope to the other flowers. 
//Then slowly the other flowers start to bloom. As, it spreads more, it becomes bright all together and a symbol of 
//hope, harmony and growth during the dark time. The center core gives strength and the other shimmering core in 
//the middle helps in the spread. It is a slow process, but it increases with intensity. The full power 
//can be seen in the end, bright and strong. So, in the midst of darkness light persists and spreads. 

//The aesthetic choices represent the tone. Deep pink is a bright color with the use of a black background. 
//It represents a flower and pink is generally a happy color. Blue is a calm color and cool color. 
//But when highly pigmented it provides a refreshing and energized effect. Yellow is a happy and warm color. 
//The center core is yellow. The hints of white stroke add to the brightness. So, all the colors go from dark to bright 
//intensity, slowly spreading joy and hope.
